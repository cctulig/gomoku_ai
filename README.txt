Instructions on compiling and running our program:

1. Download and unzip our wumpus.zip project (which you've likely done at this point)
2. Place the 5 python scripts in the same directory as the ‘referee.py’
3. Run ‘wumpus.py’ with the TWO parameters: wumpus alpha-beta

Should look something like this:
python3 wumpus.py wumpus alpha-beta
